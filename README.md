Introduction

Urban Mobility operates a network of shared electric scooters across the Rotterdam region. Travelers
can unlock scooters directly by scanning a QR-code, or reserve them in advance via the mobile app.
In this assignment, you will design and implement a secure backend system that handles user
authentication, scooter information, traveller data and admin monitoring. The focus of this assignment
is on software security. Your system must follow best practices in input validation, encryption,
logging, and secure role-based access.
This assignment consists of the design and implementation of a simple console-based interface in
Python 3 for the mentioned backend system. This system should use a local database to store the
data. You should use SQLite3 database for this purpose. Figure 1 Use Case Diagram provides an
overview of the actors and their corresponding use cases.
